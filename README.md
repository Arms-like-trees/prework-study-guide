# <Christopher's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

The purpose of this study guide was to have a central area to be able to come back to and review notes that were meanigful about the content covered.  By creating this study guide I am able to view from wherever I might be and not have to worry about not having brough it.  I learned about various aspects related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and about Git and in how all of thses come together in various aspects to create an interactive webpage for a user to interact with.


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
