The purpose of this study guide was to have a central area to be able to come back to and review notes that were meanigful about the content covered.  By creating this study guide I am able to view from wherever I might be and not have to worry about not having brough it.  I learned about various aspects related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and about Git and in how all of thses come together in various aspects to create an interactive webpage for a user to interact with.
